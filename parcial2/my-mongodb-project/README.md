# My MongoDB Project

This project is a simple application that uses MongoDB as its database. It is structured in a way that separates the database connection, data models, and the main application logic.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your local machine. You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and MongoDB from [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

### Installing

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/username/my-mongodb-project.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory
```
cd my-mongodb-project
```

3. Install the dependencies
```
npm install
```

4. Start the application
```
npm start
```

## Project Structure

The project has the following files:

- `src/db/index.js`: This file is responsible for setting up and managing the connection to the MongoDB database.

- `src/models/index.js`: This file defines the data models for the application using MongoDB's schema structure.

- `src/app.js`: This is the main application file. It imports the database connection and the models, sets up any necessary middleware, and defines the application routes.

- `package.json`: This file is the configuration file for npm. It lists the project's dependencies and scripts.

## Built With

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - The runtime environment used
